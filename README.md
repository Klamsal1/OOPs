# OOPs

This repository is your one-stop resource for exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in different programming languages.

Before contributing to this repository, make sure to read our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Our maintainers will guide you through how to make your contribution properly if you make any mistakes. The names of the maintainers of this repository are listed in the [CODEOWNERS file](.github/CODEOWNERS).

You can find a list of the language oops concepts currently in the repository in the [directory](DIRECTORY.md). Explanations of
many of the algorithms can be found in the [wiki][explanation].

## One Concept per PR

We follow a strict guideline in this project: **One Concept per Pull Request (PR)**. When contributing code or changes, please ensure that each PR focuses on a single concept, feature, or bug fix.

This guideline helps maintain code clarity, simplifies code reviews, and ensures that each PR is well-contained and easy to understand. It also allows for more straightforward testing and troubleshooting.

When creating a PR, make sure to:

- Clearly describe the concept, feature, or fix addressed by the PR.
- Avoid bundling unrelated changes in a single PR.
- Keep the scope of the PR limited to the chosen concept.

By following this guideline, we can maintain a clean and organized codebase that is easier to maintain and collaborate on.

## Branch Naming Convention

In this project, we follow a specific branch naming convention to organize code related to different programming languages and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Branch names should follow the format:

- `[DirName]`: The name of the directory or programming language you are working with. For example, `Java`, `Cpp`, `Python`, etc.
- `[Oops-Concept]`: The specific OOP concept you are exploring or implementing. For example, `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Encapsulation`, etc.

Here are some examples of valid branch names:

- `Java_Multiple-Inheritance`
- `Cpp_Class`
- `Python_Polymorphism`

By following this naming convention, it becomes easier to track and manage branches related to different programming languages and OOP concepts within the project.
