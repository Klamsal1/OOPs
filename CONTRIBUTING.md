2. **Create a New Issue**: If the issue is not already reported, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/dev-madhurendra/OOPs/issues/new). Be sure to include as much detail as possible, including a clear description and any relevant code or error messages.

3. **Follow Up**: Be prepared to provide additional information or clarification if needed and engage in discussions to help us investigate and resolve the issue.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement or a new feature, please follow these steps:

1. **Check Existing Enhancements**: Look through the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dev-madhurendra/OOPs/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested.

2. **Create a New Issue**: If it's a new idea, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/dev-madhurendra/OOPs/issues/new) and clearly describe the enhancement you have in mind. Be specific and provide context for why it would be valuable.

3. **Discuss and Collaborate**: Engage in discussions with the maintainers and the community to refine the enhancement proposal and get feedback.

## Pull Request Guidelines

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests (PRs). Here are some guidelines for creating PRs:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [OOPs-Repository](https://github.com/dev-madhurendra/OOPs) to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature`).

3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes, adhering to the project's coding style and guidelines.

4. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure that your changes work as intended and do not introduce new issues.

5. **Documentation**: If your changes affect user documentation, please update the documentation accordingly.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository's `main` branch.

7. **Code Review**: Be prepared to participate in code reviews and address any feedback or suggestions from the maintainers.

8. **Squash Commits**: If you make multiple commits, consider squashing them into a single commit with a clear and concise commit message.

9. **License**: Ensure that your contributions comply with the project's license.

## One Concept per PR

We follow a strict guideline in this project: **One Concept per Pull Request (PR)**. When contributing code or changes, please ensure that each PR focuses on a single concept, feature, or bug fix.

This guideline helps maintain code clarity, simplifies code reviews, and ensures that each PR is well-contained and easy to understand. It also allows for more straightforward testing and troubleshooting.

When creating a PR, make sure to:

- Clearly describe the concept, feature, or fix addressed by the PR.
- Avoid bundling unrelated changes in a single PR.
- Keep the scope of the PR limited to the chosen concept.

By following this guideline, we can maintain a clean and organized codebase that is easier to maintain and collaborate on.

## Branch Naming Convention

In this project, we follow a specific branch naming convention to organize code related to different programming languages and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Branch names should follow the format:

- `[DirName]`: The name of the directory or programming language you are working with. For example, `Java`, `Cpp`, `Python`, etc.
- `[Oops-Concept]`: The specific OOP concept you are exploring or implementing. For example, `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Encapsulation`, etc.

Here are some examples of valid branch names:

- `Java_Multiple-Inheritance`
- `Cpp_Class`
- `Python_Polymorphism`

By following this naming convention, it becomes easier to track and manage branches related to different programming languages and OOP concepts within the project.

## Development Setup

If you're interested in contributing code, please refer to the [development setup instructions](DEVELOPMENT.md) for details on setting up your development environment.

## License
